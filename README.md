**Conventional Commits Guide**

*Conventional Commits* is a lightweight convention for structuring commit messages. It provides a consistent and standardized format that makes it easier to understand the purpose and impact of each commit. In this guide, we'll explore how to use Conventional Commits.

**Commit Message Structure**

A Conventional Commit message consists of three main parts: the type, the scope (optional), and the description. Here's an example of a basic commit message structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Let's break down each part:

- `<type>`: This represents the type of the commit, such as *feat* for a new feature, *fix* for a bug fix, *docs* for documentation changes, and so on. You can define your own types based on your project's needs.
- `<scope>` (optional): This indicates the scope or context of the commit. It can be a specific module, component, or feature that the commit affects. If the commit doesn't have a specific scope, you can omit this part.
- `<description>`: This is a concise and descriptive summary of the changes made in the commit. It should provide enough information to understand the purpose of the commit.

**Examples**

Here are a few examples of Conventional Commit messages:

Adding a new feature:

```
feat: Add authentication module
```

Fixing a bug:

```
fix: Fix null pointer exception in user service
```

Updating documentation:

```
docs: Update installation guide
```

**Benefits of Conventional Commits**

Using Conventional Commits offers several benefits:

1. **Clarity**: By following a standardized commit message format, it becomes easier to understand the purpose and impact of each commit.
2. **Automation**: Conventional Commits can be leveraged by automated tools to generate changelogs, determine version bumps, and perform other tasks based on commit types.
3. **Collaboration**: Conventional Commits promote better collaboration among team members by providing a clear and structured way to communicate changes.

**Conclusion**

*Conventional Commits* is a powerful convention that helps improve the clarity and organization of commit messages. By adopting this convention, you can enhance collaboration, automate processes, and maintain a more consistent commit history.

Remember to customize the types and scopes based on your project's needs, and encourage your team members to follow the Conventional Commits format in their commit messages.

Happy coding!
